  Hi, my name is Martin!
  Throughout my life, I've been working in retail. I was absolutely enchanted by the feeling of community and solidarity, so I ended up starting a career.
  
  Deep down, I've always been a nerd, so after working my way up through the retail business, I ended up in a headquarter function as a consultant before (finally!) transitioning into IT.
  
  When I managed to land a job in security, I knew I had struck gold. The everchanging threat landscape; the balancing of cost vs. benefit; the complex problems that needed to be communicated in a way so the audience understood... I was enchanted.
  
  So here I am. Enjoying every day doing what I am deeply passionated about.

          Together with my team of incredibly talented specialists, we're working on keeping a high level of security in a fast-paced company in a constantly changing sector.
          
          When working in a very cost-focused environment, I quickly learnt to balance cost vs. benefit. One of my first actions when starting in the position was to go through every process and every delivery in the team to ensure that only the ones adding value remained. 
          
          This ensured maximum output and a highly motivated team, since they felt their work made a change!

          My areas of responsibility include:
           - IT Auditing
           - Security compliance (PCI DSS, EU GDPR, ISO27000)
           - Security incident response

#          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

#          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.

    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      Although I'm deeply passioned about my profession, there's more to life than work.
      
      My family is the most important element in my life - I'm definitely a family-man.
      
      Privately I live together with my girlfriend and our little dog in our new house.


      That being said, I'm also a nerd in my free time. I enjoy a good game, both board and video.
      
      Other than that I enjoy learning new stuff and a good challenge is always welcome.
