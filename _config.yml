  Hi, my name is Martin!
  Throughout my life, I've been working in retail. I was absolutely enchanted by the feeling of community and solidarity, so I ended up starting a career.
  Deep down, I've always been a nerd, so after working my way up through the retail business, I ended up in a headquarter function as a consultant before (finally!) transitioning into IT.
  When I managed to land a job in security, I knew I had struck  gold. The everchanging threat landscape; the balancing of cost vs. benefit; the complex problems that needed to be communicated in a way so the audience understood... I was in love.
  So here I am. Enjoying every day doing what I am deeply passionated about.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
